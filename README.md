## Overview
Hopefully, this will become a tool for exporting customer and order data from a WooCommerce/WordPress install into something QuickBooks and import. Fingers crossed...

## Notes
- I'm using the WordPress plugin [Export User Data](https://wordpress.org/plugins/export-user-data/).

**Export User Data**  
Select the meta fields listed below. Select CSV as the output format. Save. Export.
- Nickname
- First name
- Last name
- All Billing items
- All Shipping items

ID, user_login, user_nicename, user_email, user_url, user_registered, user_status, display_name, nickname, first_name, last_name, billing_first_name, billing_last_name, billing_company, billing_address_1, billing_address_2, billing_city, billing_postcode, billing_country, billing_state, billing_phone, billing_email, shipping_first_name, shipping_last_name, shipping_company, shipping_address_1, shipping_address_2, shipping_city, shipping_postcode, shipping_country, shipping_state
