## Overview
Hopefully, this will become a tool for exporting customer and order data from a WooCommerce/WordPress install into something QuickBooks and import. Fingers crossed...

## Notes
- I'm using the WordPress plugin [Export User Data](https://wordpress.org/plugins/export-user-data/).

**Export User Data**
Select the meta fields listed below. Select CSV as the output format. Save. Export.
